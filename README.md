📌 Overview

This project is my semester project for COAL (Computer Organization and Assembly Language).
It implements a fully working Hangman Game in MASM Assembly using the Irvine32 library.

The game demonstrates low-level concepts including:

. Manual memory handling

. Register operations

. String processing

. Console I/O using interrupts

. Logical gameplay implementation
